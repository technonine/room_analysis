# README Instructions
This code requires a recent python version (python 3.1 or higher) to run. 
This script was ran by the author on python 3.10.8 using opencv-python. 
Run pip install opencv-python to install the latest version of the package. 

Moreover the author uses pictures available separately. Send Tjalling a request for the download link.

The pictures where generated using paint.net, however any modern photo editor that can assign specific pixels colors based on RGB values will work. use RGB values: R153 G27 B30 for red, R248 G215 B49 for yellow and R0 G255 B0 for neutral space. 

# Running the Code
`main.py` has all the required code to test pictures. 
`pixel_functions.py` has the actual functions used, in case one wants to audit them.
`test.py` has a variety of functions to test the output of functions and other information.
